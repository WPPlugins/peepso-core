== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use my existing theme? =

We've tested PeepSo with dozens of major themes. But since there are thousands of themes for WordPress, it'd hard for us to test with all of them. Well, virtually impossible. The themes we recommend are the [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) and [Genesis](https://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) and we're using those in testing / development on daily basis. 

You can check PeepSo core (it's free) with that theme and if you find any problems, please report them and we'll fix whatever PeepSo might be breaking. However, if the case is that the theme itself is interfering with PeepSo's styles and overriding them in any way, there's nothing we'd be able to do. You'd have to contact the theme developers to get that fixed.

= Where do I find translations? =

Here you can download the [Translations](https://www.peepso.com/translation/).

Alternatively, you can go to https://PeepSo.com/my-account/ and download the latest versions manually. Deactivate and delete the old plugins, upload, and activate new plugins.

For the automatic upgrades to work flawlessly make sure that you upgrade all the child plugins first and upgrade PeepSo Core last. You might need to reactivate the plugins too, once PeepSo Core is upgraded. Do NOT upgrade PeepSo Core until all official child plugins before PeepSo Core.
